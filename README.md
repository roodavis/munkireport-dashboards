# munkireport-dashboards
My attempt to give back to the community that keeps me sane.

Customizable Dashboards (https://github.com/munkireport/munkireport-php/wiki/Dashboards) were added to MunkiReport(https://github.com/munkireport/munkireport-php) in version 4.0 and give admins the ability to have an unlimited number of customized views with particular widgets for different reporting needs.

The examples and files included in this repository were inspired by Kevin M. Cox on his Blog- Configuring Munkireport Dashboards (https://www.kevinmcox.com/2020/05/configuring-munkireport-dashboards/)

As far as I know hotkeys used to switch to a different dashboard are a user specific choice. So I have purposely left them blank in these files. You can add your own hotkey selection by editing the yml file and adding the appropriate key as needed. Note that "d" is reserved for the Default Dashboard and "c" is reserved for the Client Listing. There may be other reserved hotkeys that I am not yet aware of and I will update this readme file as I gather more info. Hotkeys are displayed in the dashboard dropdown if more than one dashboard is configured.
